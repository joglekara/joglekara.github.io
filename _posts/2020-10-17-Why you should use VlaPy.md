[VlaPy](https://github.com/joglekara/vlapy) was recently [published](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02182) 
in the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/). It is a Pythonic, Vlasov-Poisson-Fokker-Planck simulation 
code that distinguishes itself because of the plasma physics features it contains, the novel implementations of the integrators 
it uses for the partial differential equation, the simulation management toolkit that it relies upon, and in the performance it exhibits. 

Here's a high level summary of why you should use VlaPy:

- You should use VlaPy if
    - you are a student in plasma physics 
    - you are a plasma physics researcher interested in plasma kinetics
    - you are a plasma physics student or researcher that wants to improve their computational physics toolkit
    
- You might want to know more about VlaPy if
    - you study numerical methods for integrating partial differential equations
    - you like to think about how to write modular simulation software
    - you want to know more about the scientific Python stack
    - you like to think about architecting research software for modeling (Machine-Learning or otherwise)
    - you perform research in non-linear dynamical systems
