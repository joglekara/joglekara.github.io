A narrative surrounding my involvement in deep learning research.

### Research Scientist (2018-Present)
### Noble.AI - Deep Learning and Applied Science
I am currently a Research Scientist at Noble.AI in San Francisco, CA. Our team is responsible for the research and 
development of novel, deep-learning-based approaches to solve problems in science and engineering. Being in a software 
engineering environment has doubled my appreciation for documentation and continuous integration and testing. 

I have been fortunate enough to be able to develop upon deep-learning concepts such as Sparse Neural Networks, Inverse 
Design, Physics-based layers and loss-functions, as well as software-related concepts like scalable model 
experimentation, hyperparameter searches, logging, scalable diagnostic development, and distributed training on 
cloud-based (AWS, GCP) platforms.
