A narrative surrounding my involvement in differentiable programming and deep learning research.

### Head of AI (2020-Present)
### Noble.AI - Deep Learning and Applied Science
As the Head of AI at Noble, I am fortunate to be in a position that provides vision and leadership for the Research team.
In this role, I've grown into being more comfortable as a "facilitator" side in addition to the comfort I built
as a "contributor" in the Research Scientist role.  

I continue to facilitate, lead, and develop research initiatives in differentiable programming as related to problems in
a variety of domains such as time-series, multi-modal data fusion, higher-order regularization, and active learning.

### Research Scientist (2018-Present)
### Noble.AI - Deep Learning and Applied Science
For a couple of years, I served as a Research Scientist at Noble.AI in San Francisco, CA. 
Our team is responsible for the research and development of novel, deep-learning-based approaches to solve problems in 
science and engineering. Being in a software engineering environment has doubled my appreciation for documentation and 
continuous integration and testing. 

I have been fortunate enough to be able to develop upon deep-learning concepts such as Sparse Neural Networks, Inverse 
Design, Physics-based layers and loss-functions, as well as software-related concepts like scalable model 
experimentation, hyperparameter searches, logging, scalable diagnostic development, and distributed training on 
cloud-based (AWS, GCP) platforms.
