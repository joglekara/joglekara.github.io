A lengthy, possibly boring, narrative surrounding my involvement in physics research.

### Undergraduate (2006-2010)
### University of Michigan - Physics and Nuclear Engineering 
During my undergraduate career, I was fortunate to work with Professor Tim Chupp, and Professor Ron Gilgenbach before 
eventually working with Professor Alec Thomas. 

With Prof. Chupp, I wrote my first scientific software - a charged particle tracking routine in a static magnetic field - 
and attended my first research group meetings. 

With Prof. Gilgenbach and the Plasma, Pulsed Power, and Microwave Laboratory, I learned how researchers operate in an 
experimental setting. 

As part of the rite of passage for nuclear engineers, I also learned how to perform Monte Carlo modeling at the time, 
and was lucky enough to contribute to a published manuscript in Professor Thomas's group.  


### Graduate School (2010-2016)
### University of Michigan - Nuclear Engineering (Plasma Physics)
My Ph.D. at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor culminated in a dissertation titled `Kinetic Modeling of Magnetic 
Field Dynamics and Thermal Energy Transport in Inertial Fusion Energy Plasmas`. I worked with Professor Alec Thomas to 
discover novel mechanisms which cause magnetic fields to grow, interact, move, and dissipate. 

I developed software to model laser propagation in plasmas through ray-tracing and integrated it into a kinetic plasma 
simulation software. I learned how to use my first HPC systems. I learned many pieces of what goes into a massive 
implicit solve of $Ax=b$.  I was fortunate enough to author or co-author numerous peer-reviewed publications. 


### Summer Program (2014)
### Los Alamos National Laboratory
I spent 2 months of a summer at Los Alamos National Laboratory working with Dr. Erik Vold. Our team developed a 1D 
(radial) Fortran code to model implosion dynamics in laser-fusion experiments. This resulted in a couple of 
peer-reviewed publications.

## Postdoctoral Work (2016-2018)
#### University of Michigan - Physics and Nuclear Engineering
I was a postdoctoral researcher at UCLA with the Particle-in-Cell and Kinetic Simulation Center under the supervision of
Professor Warren Mori. Working at PICKSC gave me first-hand experience of how large-scale collaborations between 
National Labs and Universities can be fruitful towards scientific discovery and the development of scientific computing. 

I led the transition of a MPI-C++ software to be more stateful and object-oriented. We validated and benchmarked that 
plasma physics simulation software, and as part of the Center's mission, released it as open-source for the use of 
the greater plasma physics community. It is now being used at national laboratories and universities in USA, France, 
and the UK. 

During this time, I learned how to parallelize software using process-based, thread-based, and accelerator-based 
mechanisms.
