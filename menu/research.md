## Computational Physics
I've been involved in publications on the following topics. They've generally been focused on plasma physics and fusion
related topics. You can find more of a narrative [here.](./physics_research.md)

### Physics
- High-Energy-Density Physics
- Magnetic Field Dynamics
- Thermal effects and electron transport
- Linear and Non-linear electron plasma waves
- Laser-plasma interactions

### Computation
Historically, I've used C++ (and some FORTRAN). However, I've been on Team Python for the past couple of years. 
I'm also interested in Julia.

Here are some high-level topics I've used in my research.

- Monte Carlo Modeling
- Finite Difference Methods
- Pseudo-Spectral Methods
- Particle-in-cell Methods
- Ray-Tracing
- High-performance computing (1000s of cores, 100s of GPUs)
- Process-, Thread-, and Accelerator- based parallelization
- Documentation (Doxygen)

### Numerical Analysis
To perform research on the above topics, I've had to dive into the following topics.
- Implicit and Explicit Solvers and Stability Conditions
- Stiff Partial Differential Equations
- Orthogonal Decompositions (Fourier, Hermite, Legendre, Spherical Harmonics)


## Deep Learning
You can find more of a narrative [here.](./deep_learning_research.md) but I've been involved in theh following work 
so far

### Research
- Sparse Neural Networks
- Differentiable Scientific Programming
- Inverse Design
- Physics-based (through Inductive Bias) layers and loss functions


### Computation
- Scalable model experimentation
- Building architecture for logging and hyperparameter searches
- Advanced Diagnostics Development (to build and improve upon MSE, MAE etc. for specific problems)
- Distributed Training on Cloud infrastructures (AWS, GCP)
- Contributing to TensorFlow and JAX.
- Unit-testing and Continuous Integration
- Documentation (ReadTheDocs)


### Miscellaneous
I have authored or co-authored publications in `Physical Revew Letters`, `Physical Review X`, and `Physical Review E` 
amongst others. I have contributed to open-source software (e.g. `Tensorflow`, `JAX`) and maintain projects of my own.

My Google Scholar page [can be found here.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E8MzWzsAAAAJ&hl=en).

My GitHub page [is here](https://github.com/joglekara).

The following topics/concepts are near and dear to my heart and would love to have a chat with someone else interested
 in any and all of them (in no particular order of comfort level):
 
`NumPy`, `Tensorflow`, scientific computing, `JAX`, differentiable programming, parallel computing, `MPI`, `OpenMP`, 
`CUDA`, deep neural networks, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `xarray`, `hdf5`, `C++`, `Python`, `Fortran`, partial differential 
equations, Maxwell's equations, kinetic physics, Vlasov equation, Fokker-Planck equation, particle-in-cell modeling, 
Fourier transforms, Hermite Polynomials, Legendre polynomials, Spherical Harmonics, Cartesian Tensors, AWS, GCP,
simulation management, documentation.
