VlaPy was just [published]{https://github.com/joglekara/vlapy} in the [Journal of Open Source Software]{https://joss.theoj.org/}.

Here's a high level summary of why you should use VlaPy:

- You should use VlaPy if
    - you are a student in plasma physics 
    - you are a plasma physics researcher interested in plasma kinetics
    - you are a plasma physics student or researcher that wants to improve their computational physics toolkit
    
- You might want to know more about VlaPy if
    - you study numerical methods for integrating partial differential equations
    - you like to think about how to write modular simulation software
    - you want to know more about the scientific Python stack
    - you like to think about architecting research software for modeling (Machine-Learning or otherwise)
